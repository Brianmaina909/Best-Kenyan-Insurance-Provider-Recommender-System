# Example using Flask for a simple API
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import joblib

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the saved model
model = joblib.load('xgboost_model.pkl')

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])

  # Preprocess the input data (similar to training preprocessing)
  # ...
  prediction = model.predict([data]) # Assuming data is preprocessed
  return jsonify({'prediction': prediction[0]})

if __name__ == '__main__':
  app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0')
